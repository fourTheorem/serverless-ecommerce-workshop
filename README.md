# Serverless e-commerce workshop

It turns out we have accidentally discovered time travel! 😱

There is only one rule though: **we cannot use time travel to bet or play the lottery**! 😖

So, how can we profit from this amazing discovery? 🤔

Well, I have an idea: since we are cloud engineers and entrepreneurs, why don't we build a startup that allows music fans to go back in time and attend some of the concerts that made the history of music?

Sounds cool, right?

In this workshop we will be building a serverless e-commerce to sell the tickets for our music-time-travel business! Are you ready to get rich? 🤑

> **Warning**
> We can't promise you'll get (economically) rich with serverless, but taking this workshop will certainly _enrich_ your skills. And who knows where that might lead you...
